Introduction. 
There are several eye-related conditions that affect lots of people around the world. While some of them can be managed without adversely impacting the abilities of individuals to engage in their day-to-day activities, others can cause significant disruption of vision and in some cases blindness to the individual. According to NICE (2022) and Hashemi et al. (2020), approximately 36 million people are estimated to be blind worldwide and the tendency of someone to go blind depends on lots of factors and the type of eye diseases affecting them. Of the 36 million people with blindness, approximately 33.3% (12 million) of the cases is attributed to cataract.
A cataract is an eye condition where the normally clear lens of the eye is clouded, likened to conditions similar to seeing through a cloudy lens or looking through a fogged vision weather (Mayor Clinic 2021). The symptoms of cataracts can vary with patients including conditions such as
•	Blurry or cloudy visions
•	Seeing a halo around lights
•	Fading of colours
•	Seeing double visions
•	Sensitivity to light and glare
•	Difficulty to see during the night 
The progression of cataract goes with age and tend to develop slowly with time. Based on age demographics, the prevalence of cataracts is skewed towards the older generation. Hashemi et al. (2020) estimate that of those between the age of 20-39, approximately 3.0% of them are likely to suffer from cataracts, with those between 40-59 at 16.97% and those over 60 at 54.3%. There are lots of ocular examinations used in the diagnosis of cataracts which according to Mayor Clinic 2021 include Visual Acuity Text (measures the ability of the eye to see a series of letters), Slit-lamp Examination (magnification of the eyes to examine the front structure of the eye), Retinal Examination (here the and eye drop is used dilate the pupils so the doctor can examine the back of the eye) and Applanation Tonometry (measurement of fluid pressure in the eye). 
With the advancement of machine learning algorithms and computing powers, AI-based platforms are being developed to improve the speed and accuracy of medical diagnosis while reducing costs of which ocular-related disease diagnoses are not left out. There are several Machine learning and AI-based researches based on the identification of different ocular diseases. This project focuses on developing a model that will effectively identify cataracts using ocular images with an emphasis on scenarios where there is insufficient data to effectively train machine learning or deep learning algorithms.
